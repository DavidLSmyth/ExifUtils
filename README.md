ExifUtils
========================

ExifUtils is a simple library of functions written and tested in python 3.5 which allow straightforward editing metadata of jpeg images (and possibly other image formats that follow the Exif format). Built on top of the fantastic exiftool binary provided by Phil Harvey: https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/. Usage details and examples coming soon!
